# Week 9
This week was big on news and light on features. With the release of Swift 4.1 and Xcode 9.3, the rollout of Vapor 3 began, starting with [vapor/core](https://github.com/vapor/core/releases/tag/3.0.0). 

## New Features

### Migration function name

[vapor/fluent#428](https://github.com/vapor/fluent/pull/428)

### MySQL Port Now Defaults To 3306
3306 is the standard port for MySQL unless you go in and configure it yourself, so it makes sense for Fluent's configuration to default to that too. - [@0xTim](https://github.com/0xTim)

### `--option=value` Is Usable Again With The Toolbox
Throws a warning, but older commands will work again.
