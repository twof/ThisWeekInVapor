# Week 3

## News
This week, Vapor passed Perfect and has earned the title of "Most Stars of Any Server-side Swift framework on Github"! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ Congrats to the team!

## New Features

### Helper Methods to Decode Content From Request Bodies
It's very common to need to take the body of a request and decode it to an object. To cut down on this common boilerplate, new methods were introduced which take care of it automatically with any HTTP method that accepts a body:

```swift
router.post(LoginRequest.self, at: "login") { req, loginRequest -> Response in
    print(loginRequest.email) // user@vapor.codes
    print(loginRequest.password) // don't look!
    return req.makeResponse()
}
```

[vapor/vapor#1448](https://github.com/vapor/vapor/pull/1448)

### Case Insensitive Routing

While routing is still case-sensitive by default, it is now possible to choose case-insensitive routing instead:
```swift
// configure.swift
public func configure(
    _ config: inout Config,
    _ env: inout Environment,
    _ services: inout Services
) throws {
    // Register routes to the router
    let router = EngineRouter(caseInsensitive: true) // or false
    try routes(router)
    services.register(router, as: Router.self)
}

// routes.swift
router.get("hello") { req -> HTTPStatus in
    return .ok
}
```

#### Case-sensitive
`GET /hello -> 200 OK`  
`GET /Hello -> 404 Not Found`

#### Case-insensitive
`GET /hello -> 200 OK`  
`GET /Hello -> 200 OK`

_Note: The `caseInsensitive` parameter to `EngineRouter()` is brand-new and will not be usable until Vapor beta 4._

### Value Models

`struct`s can now be used as Fluent Models.

[vapor/fluent#372](https://github.com/vapor/fluent/pull/372)

## Community Contributions

### Session Redirects
[@0xTim](https://github.com/0xTim) introduced middleware to the Auth package that makes it easy to redirect users to another page if they aren't authenticated. For example, if a user attempts to visit a private page without logging in, you may want to redirect them to `/login` instead. This replicates the functionality of Vapor 2's `RedirectMiddleware`.

[vapor/auth#19](https://github.com/vapor/auth/pull/19)

### Dependency Updates
With the start of tagging, keeping `Package.swift` files up-to-date is an important but tedious task. If you're looking to pitch in, but don't know where to start, plenty of help is needed in this area. There are going to be a lot of these, so we're going to group them all together:

[vapor/fluent-postgresql#13](https://github.com/vapor/fluent-postgresql/pull/13)  
[vapor/leaf#90](https://github.com/vapor/leaf/pull/90)  
[vapor/mysql#123](https://github.com/vapor/mysql/pull/123)  
[vapor/postgresql#16](https://github.com/vapor/postgresql/pull/16)  
[vapor/fluent-postgresql#14](https://github.com/vapor/fluent-postgresql/pull/14)
[vapor/vapor#1498](https://github.com/vapor/vapor/pull/1498)  
[vapor/mysql#124](https://github.com/vapor/mysql/pull/124)

### Fixed DatabaseConnection Bug
[@bensyverson](https://github.com/bensyverson) caught that `database-kit` was making a bad assert (`==` vs `!=`)

[vapor/database-kit#6](https://github.com/vapor/database-kit/pull/6)

### Add Providers to OpenSSL
Adding providers to the `ctls` package allows SPM to let users know when they're missing a dependency - [@Yasumoto](https://github.com/Yasumoto)

[vapor/ctls#7](https://github.com/vapor/ctls/pull/7)

### Fix Issue Where Large Responses Hang
With larger HTTP bodies, the `continueBuffer` state was not being handled correctly, causing the last chunk to not be sent and responses to hang. This bug existed in both Vapor 2 and 3. Thanks! [@kevinup7](https://github.com/kevinup7)

[vapor/engine#222](https://github.com/vapor/engine/pull/222)

### Redundancy Cleanup
[@Cellane](https://github.com/Cellane) was able to cut out a couple lines of redundant code. Any cleanup is always appreciated :)

[vapor/engine#224](https://github.com/vapor/engine/pull/224)

### Allow Users of MultipartForm To Set Max Request Size
The maximum request size used to be locked at 1,000,000 bytes, but [@bensyverson](https://github.com/bensyverson)'s PR allows users to increase this value if they need something larger.

[vapor/vapor#1494](https://github.com/vapor/vapor/pull/1494)

### Fixes Packet Length and SequenceID
This fix by [@SandorDobi](https://github.com/SandorDobi) should resolve a couple MySQL bugs.

[vapor/mysql#122](https://github.com/vapor/mysql/pull/122)

### Add `delete(on:)` and `save(on:)` to `Future`
[@twof](https://github.com/twof) merged in a couple of convenience extensions on `Future` that make saving and or deleting a model much cleaner. From

```swift
return Reservation
    .query(on: databaseConnectable)
    .filter(\Reservation.user == userName)
    .first()
    .unwrap(or: Abort(.notFound, reason: "No reservations have been made"))
    .map(to: Reservation.self) { reservation in
        return reservation.delete(on: databaseConnectable).transform(to: reservation)
    }.map(to: HTTPStatus.self) { _ in
        return .ok
    }
```
to
```swift
return Reservation
    .query(on: databaseConnectable)
    .filter(\Reservation.user == userName)
    .first()
    .unwrap(or: Abort(.notFound, reason: "No reservations have been made"))
    .delete(on: databaseConnectable)
    .map(to: HTTPStatus.self) { _ in
        return .ok
    }
```

[vapor/fluent#371](https://github.com/vapor/fluent/pull/371)

### Fatal Error Cleanup
As Vapor gets closer to stability, fatal errors need to be removed so that servers aren't crashing in production. [@labradon](https://github.com/labradon) got the project well on its way by eliminating 29 fatal errors and replacing them with their proper thrown errors. (33 LoC)

[vapor/postgresql#15](https://github.com/vapor/postgresql/pull/15)

### Update Vapor Toolbox For Most Recent Version of SPM
There were a few deprecated options that made the toolbox unusable for a bit, but all is good again! - [@gwynne](https://github.com/gwynne)

[vapor/toolbox#210](https://github.com/vapor/toolbox/pull/210)

### Improved Error Message
[@gwynne](https://github.com/gwynne) updated error messages when hostname and port are misconfigured, which ought to make debugging a bit easier.

[vapor/sockets#161](https://github.com/vapor/sockets/pull/161)

## Benchmarks
### 17k Queries Per Second Per Core Achieved With Fluent/MySQL
That should scale infinitely with the number of cores too. Awesome!

### How To Set Up a Vapor 3 Project
In this tutorial [@martinlasek](https://github.com/martinlasek) takes you through all the steps needed to get you from installing Xcode to making requests to your Vapor server.

## Microtutorial
This week we're going to take a look at how to wrap up our `.map()`s to make promise chains a little more readable. We'll be continuing from last week's microtutorial:

```swift
router.get("user", UUID.parameter) { (req) -> Future<Response> in // Take in a request
    let userID = try req.parameter(UUID.self) // Turn that request into an ID

    return try User
        .find(userID, on: req) // Use that ID to search the database for a row, turn that row into an (optional) object
        .map(to: User.self) { (user) in // Unwrap the object
            guard let user = user else {throw Abort(.notFound, reason: "User Not Found")}
            return user
        }.map(to: User.self) { (user) in // Make some change to the object
            user.name = "Jamie"
            return user
        }.encode(for: req) // Turn that object into a response, and return that response
}
```

Let's see how simple we can make this route! First we'll conform `User` to `Parameter` so we can eliminate the find step.

```swift
extension User: Parameter {}

router.get("user", User.parameter) { (req) -> Future<Response> in // Take in a request `/user/<UUID of a User>
    let user = try req.parameter(User.self) // User found with UUID. Aborts if no user is found

    return try user
        .map(to: User.self) { (user) in // Make some change to the object
            user.name = "Jamie"
            return user
        }.encode(for: req) // Turn that object into a response, and return that response
}

```

With an extension to `Future` we can remove that last `.map()`

```swift
extension Future where T == User {
    public func changeName(to name: String) -> Future<Expectation> {
        return self.map(to: User.self) { (user) in
            user.name = name
            return user
        }
    }
}
```
And our final route is quite a bit more readable!

```swift
router.get("user", User.parameter) { (req) -> Future<Response> in // Take in a request `/user/<UUID of a User>
    let user = try req.parameter(User.self) // User found with UUID. Aborts if no user is found

    return try user
        .changeName(to: "Jamie") // Make some change to the object
        .encode(for: req) // Turn that object into a response, and return that response
}
```
