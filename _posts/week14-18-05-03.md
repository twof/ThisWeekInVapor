# Week 14

## News
We are back! A whole lot going on recently, most importantly Vapor 3 is tagged ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰.

## New Features

### Add ContentTag
Additional overloads to `req.content.encode(...)` were added. These allow for custom coders to be passed in as needed.

[vapor/vapor#1648](https://github.com/vapor/vapor/issues/1648)

### Add support for parsing header value params without =

Useful for parsing cookies

[vapor/core#131](https://github.com/vapor/core/pull/131)

### Add types for working with MIME
Added `MediaType`, `HeaderValue`, `CaseInsensitiveString` and `File` for content-type. 

[vapor/core#127](https://github.com/vapor/core/pull/127)

### Add 'NestedData' protocol
Adds `NestedData`: a data structure containing arbitrarily nested arrays and dictionaries

[vapor/core#126](https://github.com/vapor/core/pull/126)

### Add Thread.async(_:) method 
Runs the supplied closure on a new thread. Calls `Thread.detachNewThread(_:)`

[vapor/core#121](https://github.com/vapor/core/pull/121)

### Adds Data Coders
A type capable of decoding `Decodable`types from `Data`. 

[vapor/core#108](https://github.com/vapor/core/pull/108)

### Add a new future debug
Add debugging to future creation

[vapor/core#101](https://github.com/vapor/core/pull/101)

### Add a migration function name
Adds the ability to name migrations and to create migrations easily by just adding a closure

[vapor/fluent#428](https://github.com/vapor/fluent/pull/428)

### Adds a support for the deprecated flag
Adds support for the command's flag with the form `--option=value`

[vapor/console#63](https://github.com/vapor/console/pull/63)

## NIO
### Optimize for HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/1.0 responses
Motivation:

Its very likely that the response will be HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/1.0 so we can optimize for it by minimizing the buffer.write(...) calls.
Beside this we should also change the pattern of *.write(into: inout ByteBuffer) to extension on ByteBuffer itself.

Modifications:

- Optimize for HTTP/1.0 and 1.1
- Use extensions on ByteBuffer

Result:

Faster and more clean code.

[apple/swift-nio#300](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/pull/300)

### Add support for automatic HTTP error reporting
Motivation:

Currently the HTTP decoders can throw errors, but they will be ignored
and lead to a simple EOF. That's not ideal: in most cases we should make
a best-effort attempt to send a 4XX error code before we shut the client
down.

Modifications:

Provided a new ChannelHandler that generates 400 errors when the HTTP
decoder fails.
Added a flag to automatically add that handler to the channel pipeline.
Added the handler to the HTTP sample server.
Enabled integration test 12.

Result:

Easier error handling for HTTP servers.
